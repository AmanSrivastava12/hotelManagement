Short Summary -
This project on Hotel Management System is made to ease the management work of small scale hotels who do not have the resources and the need to maintain large databases due to their small quantity of customers. The project is made for small scale hotels since they do not keep a record of their customers and mostly use means such as a pen and a notebook for keeping a record of their customers that is not an efficient and effective way to keep record. This project focusses mainly on handling data related to rooms, such as their addition, management, booking, and the amount generated after booking the rooms for a specific time period.
